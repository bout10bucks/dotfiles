2013-12-08 08:50:10	Nahra	Namarrgon: what's strange is that dbus socket is not created at /run/user/1000/dbus/user_bus_socket but at /home/nimred/.dbus/session-bus/a922d0c6b1df4a42a03d90c4ec9ef5eb-0

2013-12-08 08:50:32	jonas_buet	rtpg: I know... but I get the feeling it's rendering too small for me. Compared to the screenshots I've seen on the web.
2013-12-08 08:50:39	grawity	Nahra: that does not look like a socket to me
2013-12-08 08:50:39	farn	krz: oh, and you should only edit the sudoers file with visudo
2013-12-08 08:50:44	Nahra	Namarrgon: I just copied /usr/lib/systemd/user/mpd.service to ~/.config/systemd/user/mpd.service as you suggested
2013-12-08 08:50:47	grawity	Nahra: and especially not a user bus socket
2013-12-08 08:50:49	jonas_buet	rtpg: so maybe there's something wrong with my config.
2013-12-08 08:51:06	Nahra	Namarrgon: let me reboot
2013-12-08 08:51:07	grawity	Nahra: rather, it's the place where the socket's address is stored, for your actual X11 session's bus
2013-12-08 08:51:16	hermod	hi, yesterday i installed arch linux on my mother's pretty old laptop (previous system was xubuntu). everything went smoothly except that the flashplayer doesn't work correctly. Videos are distorted and only show green/pink colors. The same thing happens to Teamviewer sessions ( http://en.zimagez.com/zimage/temp89.php ). I guess it's related to the video driver, but I can't figure out what's wrong. I installed xf86-video-intel and -mesa,

2013-12-08 08:51:30	rtpg	jonas_buet, you're in a terminal emulator I imagine? Try configuring gtk/qt's default font sizes
2013-12-08 08:51:33	krz	farn: ah
2013-12-08 08:51:43	grawity	Nahra: take these for /etc/systemd/user:

2013-12-08 08:51:53	rtpg	font size defaults in arch are bizarre, usually people get the feeling that they're too big

2013-12-08 08:52:15	grawity	rtpg: that is quite odd, given that Arch does not *have* its own font size defaults.

2013-12-08 08:52:30	krz	thanks farn
2013-12-08 08:52:30	hermod	it's a 32bit system with intel graphics, xfce installed
2013-12-08 08:52:38	Namarrgon	Nahra: stop the old one, edit the service, start/enable the new one
2013-12-08 08:52:43	jonas_buet	rtpg: I'm using Xterm, does its font have anything to do with gtk/qt's fonts?
2013-12-08 08:53:08	rtpg	grawity, I guess I meant more default font sizes in gtk/qt, but distros like ubuntu tweak that stuff, so we're usually not exposed to it

2013-12-08 08:53:22	grawity	tbh, it probably depends on your screen's DPI
2013-12-08 08:53:36	grawity	and on the Gtk theme you use

If the shell cannot find wine in /usr/local/bin/ why does it not proceed to the next entry in PATH and find it there?

2013-12-09 15:06:51	thetornainbow	that's what i thought, just wasn't sure. is it just determined by what specific application is rendering the theme? like certain programs use gtk-2.0 themes and others 3.0, so that's the one that gets used?
2013-12-09 15:07:20	adaedra	applications based on gtk 2 use gtk 2 theme, and same for gtk 3
2013-12-09 15:07:21	sheep	iirc it depends on which version of gtk the application is using

2013-12-09 17:39:45	poeticrpm	hugosthlm, ok, made progress. I realized that Fedora set a subvolume (its also btrfs) instead of creating separate partitions. I hadnt edited the subvolume part out. I also had to modify the boot line to remove /root in front of /boot/vmlinuz-linux. So, it booted... i think. It put me in an emergency mode ive never seen before. I could execute pacman, wicd, etc, but it says its a read only filesystem

Question now is WHY was it read only? Im going to look up how to remount read/write. I dont know how to do that while in an install as with BIOS setups i never had this issue

The strange thing is, I can use nano and pacman and all that but it says read only. If emergency mode can find the rootfs allowing it to access stuff, why cant the kernel? If I try mount -o remount,rw /   it tells me / isnt mounted or bad block. wtf??

2014-05-04 22:20:01	vee	Jakeimo: i would guess you want the MBR boot method with vbox
2014-05-04 22:20:26	vee	in that case, grub would be simple, or syslinux; you are installing on an ext4 filesystem?

2014-05-05 04:26:04	zsandu	Again this question will get very off-topic. I wanted to know how you guys approached windows updates. In my experience, every time I did them after a few days the system would go to waste. Long loading times, bugs that weren't there before. Do you think it's a bad idea to just turn them off as I do and never update? But I do have just a freeware avg antivirus for some minimum protection.
2014-05-05 04:26:18	zsandu	Namarrgon: I will get that note.

2014-05-05 05:42:12	Namarrgon	it's an arm thing?

2014-05-05 05:43:02	Milos	running reboot should run sync automagically

2014-05-05 05:47:20	tb01110100	I've been plagued by kernel panics on this machine that I built recently. I managed to grab a slightly blurry photo of the latest one:  http://i.imgur.com/U3Yp8tz.jpg  They only seem to happen under stressing tasks, but still often. This one happened while trying to build a gentoo kernel. I've already run memtest86 and it finished with no errors. Any help very much appreciated.

2014-05-05 08:31:52	jonascj	Earnestly: yes, that makes sense. So actually those mirrors which did work (no. 10-20 on my list of mirrors) were outdated since the still allowed fetching the "old" packages?

2014-05-05 08:37:13	jonascj	Also, I must admit I do not understand the difference between "pacman -Sy" and "pacman -Syu" when updating the package database. Having "u" there means I upgrade packages (-Syu is a system upgrade), but what is the catch about updating just the package database with "-Sy"? I saw this blog post (by Mr. Erling I think, it was linked to me in here) about why one shouldn't do "pacman -Sy firefox". But that didn't explain to me why one shouldn't do "pacman -Sy".
2014-05-05 08:37:55	Earnestly	jonascj: I think the key to understand this is to realise pacman doesn't have an "--install/-I" flag, it's called "sync" and for good reason

2014-05-05 08:38:34	jonascj	Earnestly: yup, I see that. But apparently one can choose only to sync the package databases with -Sy. 
2014-05-05 08:38:37	Earnestly	jonascj: You maintain two databases (see for yourself in /var/lib/pacman/{local,sync}).  local is the packages you have synchronised to your machine
2014-05-05 08:39:00	Earnestly	jonascj: sync is a list of all packages per repo compressed with gzip
2014-05-05 08:39:22	Earnestly	jonascj: Pacman is not Arch specific, but Arch Linux doesn't support partial upgrades
2014-05-05 08:39:28	Namarrgon	Earnestly: true but imo an external player still doesn't come close to uninterrupted, non-context breaking "user-experience" (lol) with all the windows-changing, different keybinds and whatnot
2014-05-05 08:39:41	Earnestly	jonascj: When you run pacman -Sy, you update the syncdbs but you don't actually synchronise your system with it

2014-05-05 08:41:04	Earnestly	jonascj: Now that you have two databases, which are out of sync, everytime you run pacman -S foo, it will fetch foo based on your local db but pull from the sync db
2014-05-05 08:41:19	Earnestly	jonascj: Which results in the situation with firefox, libreadline and bash
2014-05-05 08:41:42	jonascj	Earnestly: now I understand, thanks.
2014-05-05 08:41:44	Earnestly	jonascj: Normally it's harmless, the worst you'll see is programs will fail to start because they cannot load a shared object, which should indicate that you need to -Syu

2014-07-04 00:01:06	jrullo	bout10bucks: i now have a working system. i have no idea why. the last thing i did was start in single user mode and try using X. mouse didn't work so i had to install xf86-input-synaptics. mouse started working. rebooted and now am able to start dhclient, etc and log in as normal.
2014-07-04 00:01:16	bout10bucks	good deal
2014-07-04 00:01:31	ShadowDXS	I was wondering if someone could help me out with some problems i'm  having with touchscreen and touchpad not working right
2014-07-04 00:02:06	jrullo	also did pm -syu in between chrooting. maybe something shook loose.

2014-07-04 03:50:47	poeticrpm	wasamasa, the only issue I have with systemd is how its been so rabidly adapted and how it gobbles up things like udev in the process.

2014-07-04 05:18:35	JackWinter	urgh, since i build realtime patched kernels i normally use the ones i build too.  when i updated the linux-rt-lts kernel last time, it stopped booting from refind.  just installed grub2 and i can't boot it from there either.  does the uefi bug affect the boot process on grub2 as well as on refind?  or maybe i should start digging in why the kernel won't boot instead...

2014-07-04 08:41:54	szt	I want it to be user-exclusive
