2013-12-09 21:53:54	kristof	Takmo: A long time ago, there were lots of different implementations of Maclisp, Interlisp, and some other variants, and people (recognizing that lisp is lisp is lisp is lisp) decided to eliminate the balkanization and write the Common Lisp standard. By people, I mean some very important people. Like Guy Steele, who wrote the Java specification.

2013-12-10 00:33:23	thefryscorer	Yeah, so today I had an issue with grub-mkconfig giving syntax errors. Apparently one fix is to add GRUB_DISABLE_SUBMENU = y to /etc/default/grub
2013-12-10 00:33:35	thefryscorer	Which is what fixed it for me today.

2013-12-10 01:18:51	jonas_buet	quick question: can fdisk be used to resize partitions like Gparted? Or is parted the only solution for the command line?

2013-12-10 01:20:03	sheep	jonas_buet, yeah, but you have to delete the partition and recreate it with the same starting sector.  but sometimes fdisk doesn't let you use the original starting sector.  not sure about cfdisk
2013-12-10 01:20:10	barbeque	for some reason, my optical sound only works if I'm in a menu on my speakerset (Z5500), but other devices (eg Playstation 2) work fine
2013-12-10 01:20:14	sheep	it also doesn't resize the filesystem
2013-12-10 01:20:33	sheep	but I don't think parted does either (don't quote me on that)

2013-12-10 01:20:57	jonas_buet	sheep: so that pretty much means if I wanted to resize partition, Gparted is the way to go?

2013-12-10 01:21:25	sheep	it's the easiest way but parted works fine as long as you remember to resize the filesystems before and after
2013-12-10 01:21:39	sheep	well, before if you're shrinking and after if you're growing
2013-12-10 01:21:50	sheep	gparted handles that automatically
2013-12-10 01:22:12	jonas_buet	ok, got it. I'd really like to learn how to do it through command line.

2013-12-10 01:22:34	jonas_buet	because whenever I have to install Arch in a dual-boot setup, I always have to first boot into the Gparted live disk.
2013-12-10 01:23:01	jonas_buet	it would be very handy if I could just boot into the Arch installation media, and handle everything from there.
2013-12-10 01:23:16	sheep	it's pretty easy to create the partitions with fdisk or whatever and run the appropriate mkfs command

2013-12-10 01:23:52	sheep	resizing is tricky though since you need to remember to use resize2fs or whatever program for your filesystems

2013-12-10 01:24:08	sheep	which you can still do
2013-12-10 01:24:26	jonas_buet	sheep: So I need to shrink an existing partition and create a new one.

2013-12-10 09:09:40	MrElendig	pgrep can be quite handy
2013-12-10 09:09:41	Earnestly	MrElendig: pgrep is safer though
2013-12-10 09:09:55	Earnestly	Because you can match specific user processes, and exact matches at that

It's a list of all packages I had installed on Debian previously, and I want to install them on Arch now. However, as is natural, many of those packages don't exist inside the Arch repositories, so pacman gives errors. How can I install just the packages that pacman can find, ignoring the other ones?

I wanna build a package with a patch but rather than use abs and a .patch file, I've got my own source tree where I make my changes, I'd like to modify the PKGBUILD from that original package to use my local source directory instead of the downloadable source tarball (in short I wanna skip the download and extract of the tarball and give it a local directory instead). What's the proper way to do this please?

2013-12-10 19:37:37	jakedust	honestly: weird having this linking error right now, it's probably some missing ld flag
2013-12-10 19:37:47	vodik	hugosthlm: dependancies and abis vastly complicate what you're advocating
2013-12-10 19:38:06	Rasi	hugosthlm: arch DOES follow the open source community. developers of software have a reason to update their applications
2013-12-10 19:38:10	honestly	well, -lgcc *is* a linker flag
2013-12-10 19:38:19	honestly	and it's apparently missing from ld :P
2013-12-10 19:38:24	honestly	so I would agree
2013-12-10 19:38:27	hugosthlm	vodik: Like  what? Its hard to counter all misuderstandings or misinterpretations.

2013-12-11 16:16:35	escondida	Lorcatar: Unfortunately, Toady is definitely a Win-doze guy, so he basically designed df around being run from a single directory and not installed on multi-user systems. If you don't want to copy it to home, you're going to need to make sure your user or group has read/write permissions on various df subdirs
2013-12-11 16:16:37	nuclear_muffin	Namarrgon, There was more broken in there, so I used grub from ubuntu took a picture of the file, and copied over the parts that were generated wrong in grub from ubuntus grub

2013-12-11 17:18:17	nullspoon	I have a pam_mount question. I'm using it to mount my personal dm_crypt volume on my server. It works perfectly when I log in, but when I log out it doesn't dismount. There aren't any errors in the logs. Additionally, it does dismount when I log out from the local terminal. Has anyone gotten pam_mount to dismount on logout from ssh?

2013-12-12 01:44:02	kaictl	Okay, weird question. So I got a new computer recently, and I'm looking at the network usage for my machine. Looking in /proc/net/dev, I see that there is no traffic going over the enp4s0 device, but it's all going over the lo device. I don't have any iptables set up that could do this, but I'm wondering if this is something that happens when you use a killer 2000 nic.
