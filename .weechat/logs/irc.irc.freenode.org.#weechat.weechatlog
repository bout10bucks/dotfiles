2014-05-16 03:33:52	bout10bucks	how can I get a list of buffers in status bar? there is buffer_name, but that's only current buffer
2014-05-16 03:34:17	nils_2	/script install buffers.pl
2014-05-16 03:34:33	nils_2	add item "buffers" to your status bar
2014-05-16 03:35:24	bout10bucks	thank you, I have been staring at the user docs for a while and it's not all too clear
2014-05-16 03:36:08	nils_2	can you specify what you mean?
2014-05-16 03:37:38	bout10bucks	you answered my question, I just didn't see buffers.pl in the weechat user guide

2014-05-16 03:38:06	ihre	When migrating weechat to another system, is it as simple as copying everything from $HOME/.weechat to the same dir on another host?
2014-05-16 03:39:24	nils_2	bout10bucks: a script can be or is an third party product. how should that be part of the users guide? ;-)
2014-05-16 03:39:38	bout10bucks	true
2014-05-16 03:39:41	nils_2	ihre: yes. simply copy the whole folder to your new machine
2014-05-16 03:40:19	farn	ihre: you might want to make sure that the weechat version on the target system isn't older than the current one
